# Predicting Health Insurance Charges using Regression

Welcome to the "Predicting Health Insurance Charges using Regression" project! In this project, we explore a dataset containing health insurance information and use regression analysis to predict insurance charges based on various factors. The goal is to gain insights into the factors influencing charges and create a model that can accurately estimate healthcare costs.

## Introduction
Healthcare costs can vary greatly depending on factors like age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and region. In this project, we delve into a dataset that includes these variables and use regression analysis to build a predictive model for health insurance charges. By understanding these relationships, we aim to provide valuable insights into estimating insurance costs accurately.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the exploratory data analysis phase, we analyzed the dataset to uncover trends and relationships between variables. Some key findings from the EDA include:
- Charges tend to be higher in the southeast region compared to other regions.
- Distribution of charges varies based on smoking status and gender.

For a visual representation of these insights, refer to the [EDA Visualizations](#exploratory-data-analysis-eda) section of the notebook.

## Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for modeling, we performed essential data preprocessing steps. Categorical variables like gender, smoking status, and region were transformed into numerical format. This allows us to include them as features in our regression model.

## Model Building
We chose the Linear Regression model to predict health insurance charges. Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful technique that can capture linear relationships between variables. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, we trained the model on the training data.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of our model was evaluated using the following metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 4190.22
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 33685623.35
- R-squared (RÂ²): 0.78

These metrics provide insights into the accuracy of our model's predictions. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

## Next Steps
While our initial model demonstrates promising results, there's always room for improvement. In the future, we plan to explore more advanced regression techniques and experiment with feature engineering. By fine-tuning the model and considering additional variables, we aim to enhance the accuracy of our predictions.

## Conclusion
In this project, we successfully leveraged regression analysis to predict health insurance charges. By understanding the relationships between factors such as age, gender, smoking status, and region, we've created a model that can provide valuable estimates of healthcare costs. This project highlights the power of data analysis and modeling in making informed decisions in the healthcare domain.
